#### Brief description of features:

Users can create a new account or log in as either admin (username and password are both "admin"), or as a guest (username and password: "guest"). The admin can add an album, edit an album, and delete an album.

Placing an order generates a new order id, and these order ids are used when a user checks their order history.

Users can verify and edit their orders before placing the order by updating the quantity of individual items or removing items in their cart.

When a user logs out, their cart is preserved on the server. When they log back in, their cart items are merged with any items that they added before logging in.
